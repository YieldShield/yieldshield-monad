# Robinhood synthetic mock-feed operator

This tool monitors and refreshes only the promoted ten-feed synthetic fixture on
Robinhood testnet (chain 46630). It does not fetch live market data, change adapter
maximum ages, update bounds, or operate on Robinhood mainnet.

> **No active chain-46630 manifest is currently checked in.** The pre-hardening
> generation was quarantined on 2026-07-13 because it predates the schema-v2,
> market-session, sequencer, and codehash validation requirements. Do not operate
> that generation with current ABIs. The commands below become available again only
> after an authorized redeployment promotes a new `deployments/46630.json` manifest.

## Required manifest metadata

The deployment manifest must contain this exact object at
`fixtureMetadata.robinhoodStandardMockFeeds`:

The feed inventory is exact: missing, extra, duplicate, renamed, or incorrectly
described feeds are rejected. `expiresAt` is the earliest live feed expiration
(`updatedAt + maxPriceAgeSeconds`) and is rewritten after a successful refresh.

## Health check

```sh
npm run robinhood:mock-feeds -- health --manifest deployments/46630.json
```

The command uses `ROBINHOOD_TESTNET_RPC_URL`, unless `--rpc-url` is supplied. It exits
nonzero if the chain is not 46630, manifest inventory is incomplete, runtime codehash
or owner differs, a feed is stale/near expiry, round data is invalid, or manifest
`expiresAt` differs from the earliest live expiration.

## Refresh

Refresh requires the exact fixture identifier as an explicit acknowledgement and a
Foundry keystore whose address equals both the manifest owner and every live feed owner:

```sh
npm run robinhood:mock-feeds -- refresh \
  --manifest deployments/46630.json \
  --keystore test \
  --confirm-synthetic-fixture robinhood-standard-mock-feeds-v1
```

By default each feed's current synthetic answer is preserved; `setAnswer` is called
only to advance its round timestamps. Explicit synthetic answer changes use raw
8-decimal positive integers and may be repeated:

```sh
npm run robinhood:mock-feeds -- refresh \
  --manifest deployments/46630.json \
  --keystore test \
  --confirm-synthetic-fixture robinhood-standard-mock-feeds-v1 \
  --answer TSLA=33200000000 \
  --answer AMD=17500000000
```

The ten refreshes are separate transactions. If a network failure interrupts the
sequence, rerun health and then repeat the same confirmed refresh; preserving current
answers makes retries idempotent for feeds without explicit updates.
